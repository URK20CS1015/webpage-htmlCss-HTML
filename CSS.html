        <h3>Campus Life</h3>
    <p>With students hailing from nearly 22 states of our motherland, as well as international students and interns from different parts of the world, Karunya is as diverse as it gets. Karunya provides a platform for these students to come together to learn and grow. When people with such varied thinking come together, the potential for innovation never is enormous. From working on projects together to dining together, students in our residential University live together as one big family. It’s not only International students who come and stay with us, our students too are given the opportunity to go and study and intern at renowned Universities in various locations around the world as a part of the IAESTE programme.</p>

        <p>Manufacturing being an engine of a country’s economy, it is essential that the manufacturing processes minimize waste and reduce the environmental impact for sustainable development. Effluents from manufacturing processes are the second most reason for the pollution and global warming. The mission aims at developing technologies and processes that minimize the consumption of toxic materials in all manufacturing technologies. The mission also focuses on maximum utilization of renewable energy resources, converting waste into sustainable energy and develop products/methods to minimize hazardous wastes.</p>
